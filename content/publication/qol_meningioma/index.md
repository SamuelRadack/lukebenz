abstract: BACKGROUND:To the authorsâ€™ knowledge, limited data exist regarding long-term quality of life (QOL) for patients diagnosed withintracranial meningioma.METHODS:The data in the current study concerned 1722 meningioma cases diagnosed among residents ofConnecticut, Massachusetts, California, Texas, and North Carolina from May 1, 2006 through March 14, 2013, and 1622 controls whowere frequency matched to the cases by age, sex, and geography. These individuals were participants in a large, population-based,case-control study. Telephone interviews were used to collect data regarding QOL at the time of initial diagnosis or contact, using theMedical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 Health Survey. QOL outcomes were compared by case/control status.RESULTS:Patientsdiagnosed with meningioma reported levels of physical, emotional, and mental health functioning below those reported in a generalhealthy population. Case participants and controls differed most significantly with regard to the domains of Physical and Social Func-tioning, Role-Physical, Role-Emotional, and Vitality.CONCLUSIONS:In the current study, patients with meningioma experienced sta-tistically  significant  decreases  in  QOL  compared  with  healthy  controls  of  a  similar  demographic  breakdown,  although  thesedifferences were found to vary in clinical significance.
