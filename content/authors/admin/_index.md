My name is Luke Benz and I am a data scientist at [Medidata Solutions, Inc.](https://www.medidata.com/en/). I graduated from Yale University in 2019 with a BS in Applied Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics and Data Science.

While at Yale, I worked as a biostatistics research assistant for [Dr. Elizabeth Claus](https://publichealth.yale.edu/people/elizabeth_claus.profile) at the Yale School of Public Health, analyzing data on quality of life for patients with various kinds of brain tumors.

During the summers of 2017 and 2018, I participated in the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), where I worked as a research assistant in the Statistical Engineering Division for [Dr. Antonio Possolo](https://www.nist.gov/people/antonio-possolo) and [Dr. Andrew Rukhin](https://www.nist.gov/people/andrew-l-rukhin).

In my free time, I enjoy working on projects at the intersection of statistics and sports, and was president of the [Yale Undergraduate Sports Analytics Group](https://sports.sites.yale.edu) between 2017-2019. In addition to projects covering a wide range of sports topics, I have assisted the Yale Men's Baskeball team with various statistical tasks and have partnered with the Ivy League to help design the 2019-2027 conference schedules for men's soccer, women's soccer, and field hockey.
