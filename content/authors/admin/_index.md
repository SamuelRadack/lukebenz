My name is Luke Benz and I am a first year Biostatistics PhD Student at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. I graduated from Yale University in 2019 with a BS in Applied Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics and Data Science. While I do not yet know what my research at Harvard will entail, I have several diverse interests, including clinical trials, social networks, electronic health record (EHR) data, and cancer. 

Before coming to Harvard, I was a senior data scientist at [Medidata Solutions, Inc.](https://www.medidata.com/en/), where I most recently worked on models to select sites to use in clinical trials, and to forecast enrollment patterns and key milestones in those trials.

In my free time, I enjoy working on projects at the intersection of statistics and sports, and was president of the [Yale Undergraduate Sports Analytics Group](https://sports.sites.yale.edu) between 2017-2019. Many of my past projects have involved college basketball, and my `R` package [ncaahoopR](https://github.com/lbenz730/ncaahoopR) is designed to facilitate easy access and analysis of college basketball play-by-play data. [My most recent publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14949) related to sports examines the change in home advantage in European soccer during the COVID-19 pandemic, when games were played without fans.
