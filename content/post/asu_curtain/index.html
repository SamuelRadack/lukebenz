<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>One of the more unique student sections in college basketball belongs to the Arizon State Sun Devils and their famous “Curtain of Distraction”. The Curtain of Distraction opens to reveal students in ridiculous attire trying to do all they can to break the focus of opposing free throw shooters. Perhaps the most famous attempted distraction occured when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZWtcTkUZ0A">Olympic swimmer Michael appeard from behind the curatin wearing only a speedo</a>. Several <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-curtain-of-distraction-helps-asu-win-games/">outlets claim anecdotally</a> that Curtain of Distraction works but don’t offer statistical evidence. Justin Wolfers of The Upshot attempted to quantify the effect of the Curtain of Distraction and <a href="https://www.nytime%20s.com/2015/02/14/upshot/how-arizona-state-reinvented-free-throw-distraction.html">found it to increase ASU’s home court advantage by 1-2 points</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/img/curatain.jpg" /></p>
<p>Is the advantage still present (Wolfer’s article was written 4 years ago)? Let’s take a look, using my <a href="https://github.com/lbenz730/ncaahoopR"><code>ncaahoopR</code></a> R package.</p>

<h1>Exploratory Analysis</h1>
<p>We’ll first just look at which teams ASU has played at home and how they have faired from the charity stripe in Tempe. We begin by first scraping data for all of Arizona State’s home games for the 2018-19 season.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ncaahoopR)

### Get Arizona State&#39;s Home Games for 2018-19 Season
asu_home_games &lt;- 
  get_schedule(&quot;Arizona State&quot;) %&gt;%
  filter(date &lt;= Sys.Date(), location == &quot;H&quot;)

### Get Arizona State&#39;s Roster
asu_roster &lt;- get_roster(&quot;Arizona State&quot;)

### Get play by play data for all of Arizona State&#39;s home games this year
pbp_data &lt;- get_pbp_game(asu_home_games$game_id)</code></pre>
<p>Next, we can tag free throws as made/missed and by which team attempted the free throw.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>### Extract Free Throws
free_throws &lt;- filter(pbp_data, grepl(&quot;Free Throw&quot;, description))

### Tag Free Throw Team
free_throws$ft_team &lt;- NA
for(i in 1:nrow(free_throws)) {
  free_throws$ft_team[i] &lt;- 
    case_when(any(sapply(asu_roster$name, grepl, free_throws$description[i])) ~ 
                free_throws$home[i],
              T ~ free_throws$away[i])
}
free_throws$made &lt;- grepl(&quot;made&quot;, free_throws$description)</code></pre>
<p>Next, we’ll aggregate the results. Since play-by-play data isn’t availble for Arizona State’s home contest against Oregon State, I’ve manually added the free throw stats from that game.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sum_stats &lt;- 
  group_by(free_throws, ft_team) %&gt;%
  summarise(&quot;n_made&quot; = sum(made),
            &quot;n_attempts&quot; = n(),
            &quot;ft_pct&quot; = mean(made)) %&gt;%
  ungroup() %&gt;%
  filter(ft_team != &quot;Arizona State&quot;) %&gt;%
  bind_rows(tibble(&quot;ft_team&quot; = &quot;Oregon State&quot;, &quot;n_made&quot; = 13, 
                   &quot;n_attempts&quot; = 20, &quot;ft_pct&quot; = 0.65)) %&gt;%

<h1>A More In-Depth Look</h1>
<p>Of course, these numbers don’t mean much in context. Perhaps Kansas is a really good free throw shooting team or McNeese is a really bad free throw shooting team to begin with. What we are really interested in is how team’s free-throw shooting <em>differs</em> from their season-average when they play against Arizona State. Specifically, we’ll look at home a team’s season-averge FT% in other <strong>true road</strong> compares to road games at ASU.</p>

<p>A few play-by-play logs are not available on ESPN, but we have more than enough games to suggest that the effect of the Curtain of Distraction is reduced this year. Three teams had their best road FT shooting performance against the Sun Devils, while the majority of the others seem to fall within the reasonable range one would expect given their other performances. In fact, we can actually quantify how likely each shooting performance at ASU was. Assume that the number of free on opponent took against Arizona State follows a binomial<span class="math inline">\((n,p)\)</span> distribution where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> denotes the number of free throw attempts against ASU and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> denotes the percentage of free throws that opponent
missed in it’s other true road games. We then get the likelihood of each shooting performance against ASU as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>season_ft_stats &lt;-

<p>We see that none of the 12 opponent shooting performances differ from those teams’ normal road free throw shooting behavior in a statistically significant manner. That is to say, <strong>there is no evidence to suggest the Curtain of Distraction has had any major impact on opponent free throw shooting this season</strong>. We can see this visually in the below graphic.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>There is strong evidence to suggest that the Curtain of Distraction isn’t doing much to distract opposing free throw shooters this year. This differs from the conclusion of the Upshot piece from several years ago, but doesn’t necessarily contradict it. At the time of the Upshot article, the Curtain of Distraction had only been in existence for two years. Now, four years later, Pac 12 opponents have faced the student section several times, and teams perhaps now know what to prepare for. In any case, future research will examine when such a decline in the significance of distracting took place, and whether the trend has been on a steady decline over the last four years or whether this year is somewhat of a statistical fluke.</p>
